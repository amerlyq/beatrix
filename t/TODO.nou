TODO: test suite
  <= compare aliases and generated cmdlines w/o running them
  <= can even mock ifc -- i.e. sequence of creating dirs, building and then running

MAYBE: use "make --dry-run"
  ALT: replace SHELL var to output only cmdlines

DEV: single contiguous file with blocks "cmd -- output" separated by empty line
e.g:
  $ make r
  cmake --build '_build-clang-Debug' \
     \
     \
    --target run.Main \
  ...

  +. then I can print "diff -u" on test failure
